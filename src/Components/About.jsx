          <p className="text-sm text-justify leading-normal">
            Our mission is to bring warmth and support to underprivileged communities during the harsh winter months. By organizing donation campaigns, we aim to collect and distribute essential items like winter clothing, blankets, and other necessities to those in need. We believe that no one should have to endure the cold without adequate protection, and we are committed to fostering a spirit of generosity and community support.
